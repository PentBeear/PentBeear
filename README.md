## Hello :)

### About Me
  - I'm a generic high school student who wants to make things.
  - 3D Printer's are my favorite hobby.
  - Fabric is better than Forge.

### What I Do
  - I make apps or firmware for microcontrollers usually (Think home automation backends and such).
  - I don't post on my public Github frequently most of my repos are private. 

### My Future Plans
  - Go to college without being in horrible debt.
  - Survive climate change.
  
### Current projects
  - [ ] Design a decent 3D Printer 
  - [x] Start a HomeLab (See you on r/homelab!)
  - [x] Link one of my friends in a footnote[^1]
